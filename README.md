# GodotSteam 4.x Example Project
This is a basic example of how GodotSteam can work in your game. It is based on the [tutorials from the documentation](https://godotsteam.com/).  This example project is meant for the Godot 4.x module but should work as-is with GDExtension.

[This repo is deprecated and will be removed in November.  Our new open-source game, Skillet, will serve as the new example project.](https://github.com/GodotSteam/Skillet).
